- **Recovery**:<br/>
    !!!warning Important Note
    From Android 12.1 onwards, PE will be switching over to FBEv2 and F2FS filesystem. This means, generic TWRP/OrangeFox recoveries won't work for flashing the ROM.
    
    **However**, you might TWRP initially to get the required OFox flashed. Get the latest TWRP from [here](https://dl.twrp.me/raphael/).
    !!!
    Download OrangeFox from either of the options:<br/>
    +++ Android File Host

#### 2. Instructions

!!!danger Disclaimer
**Make a NAND backup**, and only continue if you know what you are doing. I am not responsible for anything that happens to you/your device.
!!!

!!! ADB and fastboot
Assuming ADB and fastboot are installed. Following commands are in linux format, might have to make some changes for Windows/Mac, YMMV.
!!!

- **Getting to fastboot/recovery**:
    1. Connect your phone to PC with USB debugging enabled.
    2. In a terminal, run: `adb reboot bootloader` and this will bring you to the fastboot menu.
    3. Now run: `fastboot boot twrp-3.7.0_9-0-raphael.img`<br/>(the twrp file name will be the file you downloaded from Step 1)
    4. Once in TWRP, (if your storage isn't mounted, mount it and then) transfer your `Ofox-R11.1_1-FBEv2.zip` file onto your storage.
    5. Flash the OFox recovery and the phone will auto reboot to OFox recovery.
<br/><br/>

- **Flashing firmware (Optional, but recommended)**:
    1. Transfer the firmware file you downloaded onto the storage and flash it.
<br/><br/>

- **Format/Wipe before install**:
    1. Click on the trash/garbage bin at the bottom of OFox to get to the Wipe menu.
    2. In the `Wipe tab`, select/tick **only** `Cache` and `Data` options and Wipe them.
    3. Now in the `Format Data` tab, type 'yes' and format.

- **Flash PixelExperience**:
    1. Transfer the PixelExperience zip file onto your storage.
    2. Flash the PixelExperience zip.
    3. (Optional, **NOT Recommended**) You can flash a DFE zip to remain decrypted, but I would strongly advice against it, unless you have the need to be decrypted and understand the risks of it.
    4. Reboot to System and you should now be booting PixelExperience successfully.
