Use Case","p":["When you have EC2 instances which are running when not needed (outside of work hours, on holidays, etc.) and billing you for it, Instance Scheduler will help you cut down on these costs by reducing the uptime of the server instance by shutting it down with a schedule but also conveniently bringing it back when needed (as scheduled)."]},{"l":"2. Instructions","p":["As the instance is stopping, some of your services might not boot up automatically upon restart of the instance, add them to your startup script. This would depend for each of the service you want to start. Some services might give you a startup script/command, so do check them out.","Change the options inside the office-hours period as per the image, you can edit the timings and weekdays as you need.","Change the options inside the seattle-office-hours schedule as per the image, while changing the name, description, and timezone as you need.","Check if it is working:","DynamoDB Setup:","EC2 Tags:","Enjoy saving $$$, cheers!","Ensure you're on the correct region or you will end up creating the job in the wrong region.","Frequency depends on what you would schedule your timtings as.

Open that table and click on the Explore table items button.","In the next page, just verify details and acknowledge the role creation for CloudFormation and it'll start creation of your CloudFormation Stack.","In the table, you'll find multiple period and schedules.
